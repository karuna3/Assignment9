## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(ggplot2)

url <- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States'

page<-read_html(url)

table_data <- page %>% html_node(".wikitable") %>% html_table()

table_data_transpose <- data.frame(t(table_data))

rownames(table_data_transpose) <- NULL

table_data_transpose <- table_data_transpose[-1,]

colnames(table_data_transpose)<-c("Years","DefenseBudget_Billions","TotalBudget_Trillions","DefenseBudget_Pct","DefenseSpendingChange_Pct")

dependentVariable<-as.numeric(as.character(table_data_transpose$DefenseBudget_Pct))
independentVariable<-as.numeric(as.character(table_data_transpose$TotalBudget_Trillions))

model<-lm(dependentVariable~independentVariable)

res<-resid(model)

```

```{r}

#Residual Plot

ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=independentVariable, y=res), colour = "red", size = 3) + 
   geom_segment(aes(x=independentVariable, xend=independentVariable, y=0, yend=res))+geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

```{r}
#Model Summary

summary(model)

# The intercept term here is 16.5742 and with a very low p value the coefficient is statistically significant as well

# The coefficient of the independent term is 0.6569 but the p value is very high this the coefficient is not statistically significant

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
